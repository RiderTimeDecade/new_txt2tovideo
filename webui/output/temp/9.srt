half-meter gap , painfully obvious in the crowded shot . We’d agreed to keep it

2
00:00:05,262 --> 00:00:10,912
professional . That night , Mason slipped into my room . I was watching a

3
00:00:10,925 --> 00:00:15,450
paparazzi clip — muffled audio of Ethan calling me "Ms. Feng , " then us laughing

4
00:00:15,462 --> 00:00:20,825
together , looking cozy . Mason snatched my phone and scrolled through the comments :

5
00:00:21,575 --> 00:00:27,337
"Older woman / younger guy ? I ship it ! "
"Wow , the drama hasn’t

6
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:32,075
even started , and I’m already stanning the FL and Ethan . "
"If he’s not

7
00:00:32,087 --> 00:00:38,387
calling you ‘sis , ’ he’s plotting something . "
He scowled . "Netizens will ship anything

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,737
. "
"Guess I’m just that versatile . Their edits do look cute . " I grinned

9
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:51,362
, oblivious to the danger . Mason’s expression darkened . He started unbuttoning his shirt

10
00:00:51,462 --> 00:00:56,112
, advancing on me . He spent half the night demanding answers : Who’s the

11
00:00:56,125 --> 00:01:01,350
better match — him or the puppy-eyed rookie ? Lesson learned : Never praise another

12
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:06,887
man in front of a jealous guy . The consequences are brutal . At dawn

13
00:01:06,987 --> 00:01:11,362
, Mason sneaked back to his room . I downed a coffee that morning —

14
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:15,975
no way was I surviving otherwise . On set , Ethan waved at me .

15
00:01:16,725 --> 00:01:21,850
I gave a half-hearted nod , avoiding further chat . First scene of the day

16
00:01:21,862 --> 00:01:28,025
? A kissing sequence . Our characters were newly together — building tension , then

17
00:01:28,037 --> 00:01:32,950
pulling back . Before filming even started , the set was packed with crew and

18
00:01:32,962 --> 00:01:39,487
cast . Everyone wanted to see this . Mason’s past kiss scenes were famously tame

19
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:46,787
. "Why’s everyone here ? Non-essential personnel , out ! " The director shooed the gawkers

20
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:52,400
away . "Bai’an , don’t stress . Kiss scenes are tough on day one .

21
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:58,425
Multiple takes are fine . " He patted Mason’s shoulder , clearly buying the "bad at

22
00:01:58,437 --> 00:02:03,237
kissing " rumors . The director walked us through the scene , asking if we wanted

23
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:09,950
to rehearse . "No need , " Mason said flatly . "I don’t rehearse . "
Oh

24
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,075
, you’re such a faker . I rolled my eyes and went to my seat

25
00:02:14,087 --> 00:02:20,900
. We sat close but didn’t speak . The awkwardness was palpable . "Action !

26
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:27,437
"
Mason slipped into character instantly , pulling me along . "Niannian , I’ll always be

27
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:32,512
here for you . "
As New Year’s fireworks lit the sky , his character whispe
