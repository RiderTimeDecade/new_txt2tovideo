00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,525
unctional , I let Mason drag me to a farm outside the city . It

2
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:08,975
was midsummer , and the fields were packed with sunflowers — a blazing yellow sea

3
00:00:08,987 --> 00:00:13,750
stretching to the sky , vibrant under the sunlight . We rented a bike ,

4
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,875
and Mason pedaled us along the paths , stopping now and then for photos .

5
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:24,987
His photography skills were trash — my 5’6" frame looked 5’2" in his shots .

6
00:00:25,737 --> 00:00:30,350
I roasted him endlessly . Since it was a weekday and remote , the place

7
00:00:30,362 --> 00:00:35,425
was empty . We roamed freely , not even bothering with masks , the gossip

8
00:00:35,437 --> 00:00:40,575
from yesterday long forgotten . We picked grapes , ate watermelon , and took tons

9
00:00:40,587 --> 00:00:44,250
of pictures , killing the whole day before heading back to the hotel in the

10
00:00:44,262 --> 00:00:48,950
afternoon . That night , I posted a few shots on Twitter , giving the

11
00:00:48,962 --> 00:00:54,425
fans a little update . The response was all love . I stayed for ten

12
00:00:54,437 --> 00:00:59,775
days . When he wasn’t filming , we snuck off to explore . When he

13
00:00:59,787 --> 00:01:03,412
was on set , I studied scripts in the hotel , then picked his brain

14
00:01:03,425 --> 00:01:07,962
about acting when he got back . Sure , he often "taught " me in very

15
00:01:07,975 --> 00:01:12,450
hands-on ways , but I still learned enough to feel confident about my next project

16
00:01:12,462 --> 00:01:17,075
. Once Mason’s shoot was wrapped , we flew back to New York separately to

17
00:01:17,087 --> 00:01:21,637
prep for the new series . Soon , it was time for the premiere event

18
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:26,950
. The whole cast , crew , and press showed up . After the director

19
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:31,112
handed out the traditional red envelopes , Ethan Lee came over to greet me .

20
00:01:31,862 --> 00:01:36,512
"Ms. Feng , my little sister’s a huge fan . Could I get an autograph

21
00:01:36,525 --> 00:01:42,250
for her ? "
"Of course ! Thank her for me . "
Ethan was a rising

22
00:01:42,262 --> 00:01:46,200
star from a few hit teen dramas — bright , clean-cut , the kind of

23
00:01:46,212 --> 00:01:50,462
guy I’d have crushed on before Mason . No way I was saying no to

24
00:01:50,475 --> 00:01:55,825
a handsome face . I grabbed a pen from my assistant and signed . He

25
00:01:55,837 --> 00:02:02,362
grinned . "She’ll freak out . Bragging rights for days . "
He went on about

26
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:07,612
his sister’s fangirl antics , cracking me up . Then I felt a scorching glare

27
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:13,662
from behind me . Sure enough , someone was glaring daggers . Ethan tried saying

28
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:19,487
hi to him , but Mason barely acknowledged it . So petty . During the

29
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,737
group photo , Mason stood next to me — but with a solid
