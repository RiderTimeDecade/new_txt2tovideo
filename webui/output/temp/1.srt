00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,637
At the Oscars / Grammys , Mason Jiang presented me with an award — while

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:10,487
scowling the entire time . The media reported that the award-winning actor Mason Jiang had

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,412
some beef with Anna Feng . That same night , Mason Jiang cornered me in

4
00:00:15,425 --> 00:00:20,637
the dressing room . "I can't wait anymore . "
Mason Jiang and I met at

5
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:25,812
the Oscars / Grammys , became "enemies " at the Oscars / Grammys , and officially

6
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:30,987
got together — also at the Oscars / Grammys . The first time we crossed

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,812
paths at the awards show , I was just a rookie pop star invited to

8
00:00:34,825 --> 00:00:39,337
perform . As a newcomer , I figured I should network , so I went

9
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:45,200
around scanning everyone’s QR codes — except Mason Jiang’s . The guy always looked like

10
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:49,237
he was sucking on a lemon . Even with my thick skin , I wasn’t

11
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:53,425
about to risk getting iced out . But as I walked past him , he

12
00:00:53,437 --> 00:00:57,912
pulled out his phone and flashed his QR code at me . Nervously , I

13
00:00:57,925 --> 00:01:02,662
added him — and then never messaged him . Later , I started noticing him

14
00:01:02,675 --> 00:01:07,887
"coincidentally " showing up on my trips . Took me a while to realize : Oh

15
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:13,450
. He’s into me . Turns out his personality wasn’t as cold as his resting

16
00:01:13,462 --> 00:01:19,587
face . He was sweet , romantic , and shamelessly direct . When I vacationed

17
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,800
in L.A. , he canceled his plans to play chauffeur and photographer for me .

18
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:28,762
I posted on social media craving a specific cake — the next day , he

19
00:01:28,775 --> 00:01:33,575
had it flown in from another city . My favorite K-pop group had a sold-out

20
00:01:33,587 --> 00:01:39,225
concert ? He scored bestie for me and my bestie . He spoiled me rotten

21
00:01:39,237 --> 00:01:44,075
. Hard not to fall for that . When I asked why he liked me

22
00:01:44,175 --> 00:01:48,650
, he deadpanned , "Your dance moves are hot . "
Who knew Mr. Stoic had

23
00:01:48,662 --> 00:01:52,887
a secret freaky side ? I figured it was just a fling , so when

24
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,012
he asked me out , I said I needed time to think . Then came

25
00:01:57,025 --> 00:02:02,200
the second Oscars / Grammys . That night , a bunch of hot young actors

26
00:02:02,212 --> 00:02:07,312
asked for my WhatsApp . A few single guys were extra attentive — helping me

27
00:02:07,325 --> 00:02:12,212
up the stairs , holding my dress , keeping me company . The internet lost

28
00:02:12,225 --> 00:02:17,250
it . Twitter exploded with random ship names for me and every guy I breathed

29
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:23,562
near . And Mason Jiang ? He snapped . When he handed me my award
