00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:06,250
arrived . "We’re negotiating with the hotel . For now , let’s relocate you .

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,400
"
"Planned response ? "
"Your face was hidden . We’ll say it was a new assistant

3
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:18,012
tidying his room . "
Smart — killed two birds with one stone . The new

4
00:00:18,025 --> 00:00:24,325
hotel was farther but stricter . "Only guests with NDAs here . Celebs use it

5
00:00:24,337 --> 00:00:30,675
for secret meetups . "
"Any chance of spotting other couples ? " My gossip radar pinged

6
00:00:30,687 --> 00:00:38,450
. "Relax — we booked the whole place . "
Bummer . No gossip . Chao-ge

7
00:00:38,462 --> 00:00:43,562
updated me : "The leakeder’s fired , and all footage is destroyed . "
After he

8
00:00:43,575 --> 00:00:49,312
left , I checked Mason’s swift PR moves : @ MasonJiangStudio : "The woman in

9
00:00:49,325 --> 00:00:55,512
the clip is staff prepping Mr. Jiang’s suite . She left promptly . Please refrain

10
00:00:55,525 --> 00:01:01,225
from speculation . "
They included "staff " photos and room comparisons , then sued a few

11
00:01:01,237 --> 00:01:07,762
gossip accounts . "Support justice ! Starts with one fake photo , then spins a

12
00:01:07,775 --> 00:01:12,462
whole wild story out of thin air . Do they think spreading rumors is free

13
00:01:12,475 --> 00:01:19,950
? "
"This generation of paparazzi is seriously incompetent . Posting a blurry , unrecognizable pic

14
00:01:19,962 --> 00:01:24,887
and calling it a 'trending topic '? I could do that too . "
"Is my

15
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,537
brother your go-to clickbait now ? Every time a woman appears near him , you

16
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:34,012
jump to rumors ? "
"Got here too late — missed the rumor , only saw

17
00:01:34,025 --> 00:01:39,137
the debunk . "
"Look how fast Jiang shut this down — he’s practically sprinting to

18
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:45,012
distance himself from Chloe Chen . Bet that stings for her ! "
The hired trolls

19
00:01:45,025 --> 00:01:49,250
and big fan accounts jumped in to control the narrative , and soon , netizens

20
00:01:49,262 --> 00:01:55,350
were back to bashing Chloe Chen . The topic eventually faded . That night ,

21
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,125
Mason Jiang came home looking exhausted . He hugged me for a bit , then

22
00:02:00,137 --> 00:02:06,237
went straight to shower . "No filming tomorrow . Wanna go somewhere nearby ? " he

23
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:12,050
asked , stepping out refreshed , towel-drying his hair . "After today’s trending drama ?

24
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,112
Maybe lay low ? "
"Your choice : a day out or a day in bed

25
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:23,187
. " He raised an eyebrow , smirking . "We’re going out ! " No way I

26
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,137
was risking being unable to walk the next day . But that hypocrite still pinned

27
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:33,025
me to the couch without hesitation . The next day , sore and barely f
