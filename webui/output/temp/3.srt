1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:05,262
h whomever he wants . If y’all hate it so much , crowdfund a recast

2
00:00:05,275 --> 00:00:11,100
. Maybe spend less time hating and more time studying . "
Within three minutes ,

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:17,112
my fans boosted it to the top comment . Instant satisfaction . The more his

4
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:22,037
fans raged , the harder he spoiled me . Nothing shut them up faster than

5
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,250
their idol publicly choosing me . Mason left early the next morning for a shoot

6
00:00:27,262 --> 00:00:32,675
. I woke up at noon and checked Twitter . A trending tag : #

7
00:00:32,687 --> 00:00:39,200
MasonJiangAirport He wore a basic tee and shorts , but his face ? Illegal .

8
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:44,625
Sharp jawline , deep-set eyes , towering height — he waved at fans ( which

9
00:00:44,637 --> 00:00:50,600
he never does ), sending them into hysterics . Total heartbreaker . And I fell

10
00:00:50,612 --> 00:00:56,400
for it . Who knew Mr. Aloof was secretly clingy and shameless ? "Wait …

11
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:02,287
are those teeth marks on Mason’s collarbone ? "
"OMG , I SEE IT ! That

12
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:09,387
wasn’t there before ! "
Fans with forensic-level zoom skills posted comparison shots . My face

13
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,075
burned . He’d be on set for a month — last night got … intense

14
00:01:14,087 --> 00:01:20,150
. "Why does Mason seem weirdly happy today ? Still stone-faced , but he waved

15
00:01:20,162 --> 00:01:27,012
? Suspicious . "
"Somebody had a very good night . "
Then , Chloe Chen tweeted

16
00:01:27,112 --> 00:01:32,662
: "So tired . Don’t wanna get up . "
Since Mason was currently filming with

17
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:38,362
her , fans connected imaginary dots . "Am I the only one thinking this ‘exhaustion

18
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:44,100
’ matches the bite marks ? "
"Nope ! Mason’s always so cold — who knew he

19
00:01:44,112 --> 00:01:48,362
was wild in private ? "
"Say what you will about Chloe , but she and

20
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:53,462
Mason do look good together . "
I saw red and replied , "Chloe’s radar for

21
00:01:53,475 --> 00:02:00,025
clout is sharper than NASA’s . "
I forgot to switch accounts . Instantly , 99

22
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:05,450
+ notifications : "She’s not wrong , but Anna … babe , your main account

23
00:02:05,462 --> 00:02:13,812
? !"
"LMAO , Anna Feng , unhinged queen . Spitting facts . "
Full-blown humiliation .

24
00:02:14,562 --> 00:02:19,375
And just like that , Chloe and I were mortal enemies . After my agent

25
00:02:19,387 --> 00:02:23,512
chewed me out , I posted : "Oops , gossipm forgot to switch accounts .

26
00:02:24,262 --> 00:02:30,175
Sorry ! "
Mason’s studio quickly dropped his schedule , proving he and Chloe weren’t even

27
00:02:30,187 --> 00:02:35,812
in the same state . Chloe backpedaled : "Just tired from work ! Don’t read

28
00:02:35,825 --> 00:02:42,362
into it . "
I rolled my eyes . Sure , Jan . Then Mason
