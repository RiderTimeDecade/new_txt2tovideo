1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:05,550
s face was pure thunder . The media ran wild with theories : Mason Jiang

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:10,737
, the classically trained actor , looks down on pop stars-turned-actresses like Anna Feng .

3
00:00:11,487 --> 00:00:16,000
The awards only gave her Best Newcomer for clout , and forcing Mason to present

4
00:00:16,012 --> 00:00:19,925
it pissed him off . No one knew the truth — that later , he

5
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:23,762
pinned me against a wall , kissed me like he was starving , and growled

6
00:00:23,775 --> 00:00:29,575
, "You said you needed time . Well , I can’t wait anymore . "
I

7
00:00:29,587 --> 00:00:34,600
thought , Hey , He’s hot . Why not give it a try ? So

8
00:00:34,612 --> 00:00:40,037
we got together . Somehow , two years flew by . When I asked him

9
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,287
later why his confession was so shallow , he shrugged . "Guys , notice looks

10
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:51,625
first . What’s the big deal ? "
Hard to argue with that logic . Since

11
00:00:51,637 --> 00:00:56,237
I was still climbing the ladder , we agreed to keep things low-key . Cue

12
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,987
the media spinning "Mason Jiang and Anna Feng : sworn rivals , can’t stand each

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,775
other . "
Then my agent , Dana , called — our new drama was officially

14
00:01:05,787 --> 00:01:12,112
announced . I retweeted the promo post and tagged Mason . The comments exploded .

15
00:01:12,862 --> 00:01:19,425
"Wow , money talks ! Two A-listers who ‘hate each other ’ suddenly co-starring ? "
"Mason

16
00:01:19,437 --> 00:01:24,637
just won Best Actor , and now he’s stuck carrying this talentless hack ? "
"Rumor

17
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:29,525
has it Chloe Chen was originally cast . Anna Feng stole the role — y’all

18
00:01:29,537 --> 00:01:35,925
know how . "
"Notice how Anna always lands big co-stars ? Wonder who’s backing her

19
00:01:35,937 --> 00:01:42,387
. "
"Anna’s shows dominate ratings . She’s the top rising star — Mason’s fans need

20
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,687
to chill . "
"OMG , the visuals ! Cold , brooding king x fiery beauty

21
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:54,862
? YES . "
Eight out of ten comments trashed me . One was a timid

22
00:01:54,875 --> 00:02:01,387
fan defense . The last ? Pure thirst over our looks . I kicked the

23
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,687
drama’s other lead — currently sprawled on my couch watching TV . "Your fans are

24
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,750
dragging me again . "
Mason grabbed my foot , rubbing his thumb along my ankle

25
00:02:11,762 --> 00:02:17,850
like a creep . "Want me to clap back ? "
"No ! We’re ‘enemies ,

26
00:02:17,862 --> 00:02:24,800
’ remember ? " Image first . "Use your fake account . " But I still wanted payback

27
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:29,012
. Laughing at my pettiness , he logged into the alt I made for him

28
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:35,425
and replied to a hate comment : "Random lurker here . Mason’s fans are unhinged
