1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:06,262
texted : "Damage controlled . "
Me : "Good job . You'll get your reward later

2
00:00:06,275 --> 00:00:11,887
. "
Him , instantly : "What kind ? "
Before I could answer , Dana called

3
00:00:11,987 --> 00:00:17,812
— Vanity Fair needed an interview last-minute . "So sudden ? I was prepping for

4
00:00:17,825 --> 00:00:23,700
Mason’s drama . " His acting debut — no room for mistakes . "Just half a

5
00:00:23,712 --> 00:00:29,537
day . They got ghosted by another actress . Since you’re in NYC , they

6
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,362
begged us . They’ve always supported you — hard to say no . "
My vacation

7
00:00:35,462 --> 00:00:42,462
: over . Ignoring Mason’s rapid-fire texts ( "Schoolgirl outfit ? Fishnets ? ?"), I skimmed

8
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:47,387
the interview questions . The shoot went smoothly — we’d worked with them before .

9
00:00:48,137 --> 00:00:53,487
That night , Vanity Fair dropped a gossipser clip . The interviewer asked : "You

10
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:59,087
once said you only date based on looks . Still true ? "
"Mostly , " I

11
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,512
laughed . "Looks are still key . But now I’d want someone who … sticks

12
00:01:04,525 --> 00:01:09,950
around . Travels with me , grocery shops , cooks , watches bad movies .

13
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:15,662
Someone who always says goodnight , no matter where they are . "
I’d bullshitted this

14
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:21,725
question a million times before . But now ? I was just describing Mason .

15
00:01:22,475 --> 00:01:29,425
The internet noticed . "LMAO . Anna stays loyal to her ‘hot or nothing ’ policy

16
00:01:29,437 --> 00:01:35,812
. "
"Wait … she got specific . Those sound like real memories . Is she

17
00:01:35,825 --> 00:01:41,800
dating someone ? "
"PSA : When celebs switch from generic ‘tall , funny ’ to hyper-detailed

18
00:01:41,812 --> 00:01:50,025
scenarios ? They’re taken . "
Damn . The internet’s too smart . "Since everyone’s so

19
00:01:50,037 --> 00:01:53,775
interested in An’an , let me hype up her new drama that’s about to air

20
00:01:53,787 --> 00:01:59,137
! "
"To all the haters above : An’an has clarified multiple times that she’s single

21
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:05,837
. [Photo ] Stop making baseless assumptions ! "
Fans rallied to promote my upcoming drama

22
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:11,325
while reposting my past statements about being single , gradually steering the comments section back

23
00:02:11,337 --> 00:02:16,225
on track . Reading their supportive messages , I felt a pang of guilt .

24
00:02:16,975 --> 00:02:21,962
If my personal life ever blew up , they’d be so disappointed . Just then

25
00:02:22,062 --> 00:02:25,700
, a text from Mason Jiang popped up : "Honored to be your ideal type

26
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:31,850
. Miss you . "
Ugh , so cringe ! Even though we’d only been apart

27
00:02:31,862 --> 00:02:35,975
for a day , I kinda missed him too . So I booked a flight
