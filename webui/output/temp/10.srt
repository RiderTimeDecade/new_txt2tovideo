00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,750
red the promise , then kissed me . It started soft — just a brush

2
00:00:04,762 --> 00:00:09,062
of lips . When I parted mine , he deepened it , the heat building

3
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:14,962
until he abruptly pulled away , leaving me dazed . "Niannian ... " His voice was

4
00:00:14,975 --> 00:00:22,262
rough , like he was holding back . "Cut ! " Mason detached immediately . "Perfect

5
00:00:22,262 --> 00:00:27,387
! Didn’t know you had that in you , Bai’an ! " The director was thrilled

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:33,087
. One take . Mason stayed deadpan , like the guy who’d just kissed me

7
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:38,200
breathless was someone else . Meanwhile , I was the one struggling to separate him

8
00:00:38,212 --> 00:00:43,075
from his role . His character reminded me of Mason when we first got together

9
00:00:43,175 --> 00:00:48,062
— restrained but intense . "Ms. Feng , you’re not just a great singer —

10
00:00:48,062 --> 00:00:55,375
your acting’s unreal . That shy , flustered vibe ? Chef’s kiss . " Ethan swooped

11
00:00:55,387 --> 00:01:00,525
in with the flattery . I glanced at Mason . He quirked a brow ,

12
00:01:00,525 --> 00:01:05,337
smirking , like Remember last night ? "Uh , Jiang’s a good scene partner ,

13
00:01:05,337 --> 00:01:10,062
" I mumbled , then bolted to my trailer . Mason texted me : "Thank God

14
00:01:10,075 --> 00:01:16,675
the director called cut . Almost lost control there . "
Me : "... "
Do your fans

15
00:01:16,687 --> 00:01:21,512
know you’re secretly a horny menace ? That night , a forum post blew up

16
00:01:21,525 --> 00:01:26,800
: "I work on a certain A-list drama set . "
"Today was their first kiss

17
00:01:26,812 --> 00:01:31,787
scene . The ML barely has experience , but they nailed it in one take

18
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:37,412
. "
"Soon as they cut , he walked off . Zero interaction with the FL

19
00:01:37,512 --> 00:01:43,262
— acted like she had the plague . "
"Poor pop princess . "
"Meanwhile , Ethan

20
00:01:43,275 --> 00:01:49,550
and the FL were laughing nonstop . Total chemistry ! "
Only one project fit the

21
00:01:49,562 --> 00:01:56,225
description . Netizens connected the dots fast . "If it’s that show , no surprise

22
00:01:56,237 --> 00:02:02,812
. Dude avoids actresses like they’re poison . Pretty sure he’s gay . "
I showed

23
00:02:02,825 --> 00:02:08,725
Mason the thread . "Hah ! They think you’re into guys ! "
He gave me

24
00:02:08,737 --> 00:02:13,550
a look . "You tell me . "
"Before you , I also thought you were

25
00:02:13,562 --> 00:02:18,950
celibate . You know how many fan edits pair you as the bottom ? "
Mason’s

26
00:02:18,962 --> 00:02:23,312
face went green . "Guess I haven’t been thorough enough if you doubt me .

27
00:02:24,062 --> 00:02:31,237
"
"No , no ! You’re , uh , very energetic . Peak masculinity ! " I

28
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:36,375
backpedaled fast . He seemed appeased — until he saw the comments shipping me and
