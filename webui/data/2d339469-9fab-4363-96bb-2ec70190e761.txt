At the Oscars/Grammys, Mason Jiang presented me with an award—while scowling the entire time.
The media reported that the award-winning actor Mason Jiang had some beef with Anna Feng.
That same night, Mason Jiang cornered me in the dressing room. "I can't wait anymore."
Mason Jiang and I met at the Oscars/Grammys, became "enemies" at the Oscars/Grammys, and officially got together—also at the Oscars/Grammys.
The first time we crossed paths at the awards show, I was just a rookie pop star invited to perform.
As a newcomer, I figured I should network, so I went around scanning everyone’s QR codes—except Mason Jiang’s.
The guy always looked like he was sucking on a lemon. Even with my thick skin, I wasn’t about to risk getting iced out.
But as I walked past him, he pulled out his phone and flashed his QR code at me.
Nervously, I added him—and then never messaged him.
Later, I started noticing him "coincidentally" showing up on my trips.
Took me a while to realize: Oh. He’s into me.
Turns out his personality wasn’t as cold as his resting face. He was sweet, romantic, and shamelessly direct.
When I vacationed in L.A., he canceled his plans to play chauffeur and photographer for me.
I posted on social media craving a specific cake—the next day, he had it flown in from another city.
My favorite K-pop group had a sold-out concert? He scored bestie for me and my bestie.
He spoiled me rotten. Hard not to fall for that.
When I asked why he liked me, he deadpanned, "Your dance moves are hot."
Who knew Mr. Stoic had a secret freaky side?
I figured it was just a fling, so when he asked me out, I said I needed time to think.
Then came the second Oscars/Grammys.
That night, a bunch of hot young actors asked for my WhatsApp. A few single guys were extra attentive—helping me up the stairs, holding my dress, keeping me company.
The internet lost it. Twitter exploded with random ship names for me and every guy I breathed near.
And Mason Jiang? He snapped.
When he handed me my award, his face was pure thunder. The media ran wild with theories: Mason Jiang, the classically trained actor, looks down on pop stars-turned-actresses like Anna Feng. The awards only gave her Best Newcomer for clout, and forcing Mason to present it pissed him off.
No one knew the truth—that later, he pinned me against a wall, kissed me like he was starving, and growled,
"You said you needed time. Well, I can’t wait anymore."
I thought, Hey, He’s hot. Why not give it a try?
So we got together.
Somehow, two years flew by.
