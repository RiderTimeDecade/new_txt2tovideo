At the Oscars/Grammys, Mason Jiang presented me with an award—while scowling the entire time.
The media reported that the award-winning actor Mason Jiang had some beef with Anna Feng.
That same night, Mason Jiang cornered me in the dressing room. "I can't wait anymore."
Mason Jiang and I met at the Oscars/Grammys, became "enemies" at the Oscars/Grammys, and officially got together—also at the Oscars/Grammys.
The first time we crossed paths at the awards show, I was just a rookie pop star invited to perform.
As a newcomer, I figured I should network, so I went around scanning everyone’s QR codes—except Mason Jiang’s.
The guy always looked like he was sucking on a lemon. Even with my thick skin, I wasn’t about to risk getting iced out.
But as I walked past him, he pulled out his phone and flashed his QR code at me.
Nervously, I added him—and then never messaged him.
Later, I started noticing him "coincidentally" showing up on my trips.
Took me a while to realize: Oh. He’s into me.
Turns out his personality wasn’t as cold as his resting face. He was sweet, romantic, and shamelessly direct.
When I vacationed in L.A., he canceled his plans to play chauffeur and photographer for me.
I posted on social media craving a specific cake—the next day, he had it flown in from another city.
